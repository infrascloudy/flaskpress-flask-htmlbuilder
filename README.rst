HTML builder for Python and Flask

Flask-HTMLBuilder
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Flask-HTMLBuilder is a Flask extension that allows flexible and easy
Python-only generation of HTML snippets and full HTML documents using a
robust syntax.  For more advanced usage it provides a lean template
inheritance system that is intertwined with the Flask/Werkzeug endpoint
mechanisms.
